<h1>Two pointers</h1>
* Two pointer is strategy used in algorithm design particularly when dealing with arrays or linked lists.
* Imagine two pointer and place each at different ends or positions of an array. These pointers traverse through the array, helping you to compare, search or even manipulate the data efficiently. 

**Usage**
* Ordered data structures: This pattern mainly applied to ordered arrays or lists to make position based decisions that can significantly optimize the algorithm.
* Efficiency: Reducing the nested loops, helps in acheiving the linear time complexity O(n).

**Pros and Cons**
* Pros:
    - Efficiency: O(n) for problems which requires O(n<sup>2</sup>).
* Cons:
    - Applicable for the problems involving sequences or intervals
    - finding complexity in understanding the pattern and how to move pointers.
